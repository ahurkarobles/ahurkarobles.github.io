	<p>A critical thinker, a storyteller, a do-gooder and a dreamer. Above all, I pride myself on my sense of empathy. It's helped me excel in a variety of fields; as a filmmaker, a workers' right advocate, and a web designer. Through my design work, I've come to understand that UX is a field I'm uniquely suited to. Combine storytelling ability, a desire to help others, an impulse to challenge assumptions, and a keen eye for aesthetics, and you have a fresh UX designer who is ready to work hard to make a user's life easier.
