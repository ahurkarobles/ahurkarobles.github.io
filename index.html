<p>My name is Ana Hurka-Robles, but people on the internet call me AHR. It's easier to type.</p>
	<p>I've worked in many creative fields, and in each one I've produced work that connected with people. When I left my job as a web video producer at an awesome tech site, my farewell blog post received hundreds of comments from users who felt they had gotten to know me through my work. As a web producer, I re-juvinated the look and feel of an established site in a way that delighted my team members and our readers. As a UX designer, I work hard to figure out what people want and what they need. I'm always thinking about how to make it easier for people to make a decent life for themselves. There's a lot of confusion and miscommunication in the world, and I want help make things a little more understandable. I'm into good conversation and moments of clarity.<p>
